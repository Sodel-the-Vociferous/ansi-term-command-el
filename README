Emacs' `eshell' is great until you want to run a command that needs a
full ANSI terminal. Eshell can run Lisp commands, so you *could* use
`ansi-term', but, `ansi-term' doesn't accept a command with
command-line arguments.

But, that's okay, because `ansi-term-command' does!

Just load this extension up, open up an eshell, and try this:

 $ ansi-term-command nano ~/.emacs

Or this:

 $ ansi-term-command nethack
